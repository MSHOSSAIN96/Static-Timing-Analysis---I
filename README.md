# Static-Timing-Analysis-I
Static timing analysis comprises broadly for timing checks, constraints and library. This directory will give an eagle's eye to every timing check that is being performed in current industries for sign-off. This will also introduce us to basic terminologies for timing, which are needed for adavanced STA. 

**Introduction and agenda**

**Section: 1.1 Introduction**

The curriculum of Static Timing Analysis is divided into three core areas:

Timing Checks:
These are the first-level diagnostics we perform on a chip. Think of these as the essential setup checks—covering everything from setup, hold, and other timing violations.

Constraints:
Constraints are essentially the rules and specifications that define how a design should behave. They determine performance goals like frequency, throughput, MIPS, and more. You'll learn how to define and manage these constraints effectively.

Libraries:
Libraries are where the delay models come into play. These models represent the behavior of various cells and gates, which are the building blocks of a chip.

I’ll dive into different models like NLDM (Non-Linear Delay Model) and CCS (Current Source Model).
While I cover the basics of these libraries, a more detailed discussion on advanced modeling techniques will be available in a separate course.


From this directory I’ll be able to:

a.Analyze timing reports from a qualitative perspective, rather than just quantitative.

b.Diagnose and address design issues effectively.

c.Come up with optimal solutions quickly and efficiently.

In conclusion, this directory is gateway to mastering static timing analysis—equipping us with the skills to tackle real-world challenges in chip design with confidence.


**Section 1.2 Introduction to timing path and arrival time**

In this directory, I will explore the critical aspects of Static Timing Analysis (STA), focusing on its checks, constraints, and libraries. These elements form the backbone of STA and help ensure the functionality and reliability of digital designs.

Overview of Static Timing Analysis:

When I talk about STA, the most common concepts that come to mind are setup checks, hold checks, and other related timing checks. These checks are fundamental and will be the primary focus of this directory.

Constraints: Define the performance requirements of a design, such as frequency and throughput, ensuring the design meets the required specifications.

Libraries: Provide the models (e.g., delay models) used to calculate and validate timing paths.

Understanding Timing Paths:

At the heart of STA is the concept of timing paths. Timing paths are critical for understanding how signals propagate through a circuit and whether they meet design requirements.

What is a Timing Path?
A timing path consists of:

Start Point: Defined by elements like input ports or launch flops.

End Point: Defined by elements like output ports or capture flops.

For example:

A signal starts at a launch flop or input port.

It travels through the combinational logic and clock network.

It ends at a capture flop or output port.

Identifying Valid Timing Paths

Launch Flop to Capture Flop:
The clock signal launches the data from a register and captures it at another register.
This is one of the most common timing paths.

Input Port to Capture Flop:
The signal starts at an input port and is captured at a register.

Launch Flop to Output Port:
The signal is launched from a register and ends at an output port.

Input Port to Output Port:
The signal starts at an input port and propagates directly to an output port through combinational logic.

For a simple design, identifying these paths is relatively straightforward. However, for complex designs with millions of instances, identifying valid timing paths becomes significantly more challenging.

**Arrival Time**

Once I’ve identified timing paths, the next step is to calculate the arrival time.

What is Arrival Time?

Arrival time is the time required for a signal to propagate from the start point to the end point of a timing path.

For example, in a path from a launch flop to a capture flop, the arrival time would be the time taken for the signal to traverse the logic and reach the capture flop.

In STA, arrival time is calculated at the end point of each timing path.

Complexity of Arrival Time Calculation

For simple designs, calculating arrival time may seem straightforward. However, for output ports or complex designs, it becomes more nuanced. For instance:

An output port may have multiple contributing signals, requiring careful analysis to determine which signal dominates.
Calculations must account for all possible delays and path dependencies to ensure accuracy.

Required Time
The next critical concept in STA is required time.

What is Required Time?
Required time defines the maximum time a signal can take to traverse a timing path while still meeting the design's specifications.

It is derived from system constraints such as:

Frequency requirements: For example, if a system operates at 1 GHz, the clock period is 1 ns. The required time for each path must align with this constraint.

**Required Time**

Definition: The expected time within which a signal must reach the end point to meet design specifications. Think of it as the "party start time"—we need to arrive on time to avoid being late. Constraints are used to define these requirements (e.g., a signal should arrive between 0.5 ns and 3 ns).

**Example Calculations**

Consider a timing path with the following requirements:

Minimum Required Time: 0.5 ns
Maximum Required Time: 3 ns

Case 1: Arrival time = 2.5 ns

This meets both the minimum and maximum requirements.
Setup Slack = 3 ns (required) - 2.5 ns (arrival) = +0.5 ns
Positive slack indicates the design is valid.

Case 2: Arrival time = 3.5 ns

This violates the maximum required time (3 ns).
Setup Slack = 3 ns (required) - 3.5 ns (arrival) = -0.5 ns
Negative slack indicates a timing violation.

Case 3: Arrival time = 0.3 ns

This violates the minimum required time (0.5 ns).
Hold Slack = 0.3 ns (arrival) - 0.5 ns (required minimum) = -0.2 ns
Again, negative slack indicates a timing violation.

Types of Timing Analysis

Setup Analysis

Focuses on ensuring signals meet the maximum required time.
Example: Ensuring data is stable before the next clock edge.

Hold Analysis

Focuses on ensuring signals meet the minimum required time.
Example: Ensuring data is stable immediately after a clock edge.

Other Timing Checks

Apart from setup and hold, there are additional checks such as clock gating checks, pulse width checks, and asynchronous domain crossing checks.
